# Procedurally generated Lo-Fi Hip-Hop

This is a simple project dedicated to create loads of lo-fi hip-hop. It uses some of musical theory, simple (as for now) Markovian mechanism and a bunch of libraries for generating midi and wav file and fusing them together.

# Built with

* Python
* Pydub
* MIDIUtil
* MIDI2Audio
* NumPy, SciPy for filtering the audio

# To-Do

1. Improve melody generator from basic pentatonic in given scale.
2. Make library of instruments and sound effects bigger.
3. Improve choosing of sound effects.
4. Make a good storage of created songs instead of replacing them.
